	World of Warcraft


Four years have passed since the aftermath 
of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, and a great 
tension now smolders throughout the ravaged 
world of Azeroth. As the battle-worn races 
begin to rebuild their shattered kingdoms, 
new threats, both ancient and ominous, arise 
to plague the world once again. World of Warcraft 
is an online role-playing experience set in the 
award-winning Warcraft universe. Players assume 
the roles of Warcraft heroes as they explore, 
adventure, and quest across a vast world. Being 
"Massively Multiplayer," World of Warcraft allows 
thousands of players to interact within the same 
world. Whether adventuring together or fighting 
against each other in epic battles, players will 
form friendships, forge alliances, and compete with 
enemies for power and glory. A dedicated live team 
will create a constant stream of new adventures to 
undertake, lands to explore, and monsters to vanquish. 
This content ensures that the game will never be the 
same from month to month, and will continue to offer 
new challenges and adventures for years to come.
