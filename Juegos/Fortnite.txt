The Storm came without warning and 
wiped out 98 percent of the world's 
population in a flash. Poof. Adios. 
Sayonara. Then came the monsters, wave 
after wave, night after night. Destroying 
everything in their path. But it's not all 
doom and gloom. In an abandoned missile 
silo, we've found one of our first weapons 
against the Storm you. We're looking for a 
few good commanders like you to help make 
a difference, push back the storm and 
protect those among us who are unable to 
protect themselves. Explore the world. 
Rescue survivors. Make hundreds of guns, 
swords, and things that go boom. Make 
impregnable forts. Tastefully decorate with 
sniper perches, poison gas traps, and jump pads. 
Take back the world. You know, the usual. 
And be sure to invite your friends.
