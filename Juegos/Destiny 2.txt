	Destiny 2


In Destiny 2, the last safe city on Earth 
has fallen and lays in ruins, occupied by 
a powerful new enemy and his elite army, the 
Red Legion. Every player creates his own 
character called a “Guardian,” humanity’s chosen 
protectors. As a Guardian in Destiny 2, players 
must master new abilities and weapons to reunite 
the city’s forces, stand together and fight back 
to reclaim their home. In Destiny 2 players 
embark on a fresh story filled with new 
destinations around our solar system to explore, 
and an expansive amount of activities to discover. 
There is something for almost every type of gamer in 
Destiny 2, including gameplay for solo, cooperative 
and competitive players set within a vast, evolving 
and exciting universe.
