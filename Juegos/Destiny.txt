	Destiny



To battle the Darkness and the Taken army, 
players get brand new subclasses with new 
supers. Warlocks now harness the power of 
an electric storm, Hunters carve a bow formed 
from gravitational void energy, and Titans 
summon a flaming hammer that can sear their 
adversaries from a range or deliver a 
devastating melee impact.
