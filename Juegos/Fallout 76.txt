	Fallout 76



Fallout 76 is the online prequel where every 
surviving human is a real person. Work 
together – or not – to survive. Under the threat 
of nuclear annihilation, you’ll experience the 
largest, most dynamic world ever created in the 
legendary Fallout universe. Reclamation Day, 2102. 
25 years after the bombs fall, you and your fellow 
Vault Dwellers – chosen from the nation’s best and 
brightest – emerge into post-nuclear America. Play 
alone or band together as you explore, quest, build 
and triumph against the wasteland’s greatest threats. 
Multiplayer finally comes to the epic open-world RPGs 
of Bethesda Game Studios. Create your character with 
the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system and forge your own path in a 
new and untamed wasteland with hundreds of locations. 
Whether you journey alone or with friends, a new and 
unique Fallout adventure awaits. Use the all-new 
Construction and Assembly Mobile Platform (C.A.M.P.) 
to build and craft anywhere in the world. Your C.A.M.P. 
will provide much-needed shelter, supplies and safety. 
You can even set up shop to trade goods with other survivors.
But beware, not everyone will be quite so neighborly.
