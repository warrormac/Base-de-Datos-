	Tom Clancys The Division 2



Set in Washington D.C., the game takes place 7 months 
after a deadly virus was released in New York City and 
the nation has become a shell of its former self. While 
the virus has been contained, its effects are most evident 
in the devastated streets of the nation's capital where 
survivors cling to hope and struggle to rebuild. Enter 
The Division, a unit of civilian sleeper agents who 
now must work to stop enemy factions from completely 
taking over the city – and ultimately, the nation. As 
a universally-regarded seat of power, if D.C. falls, 
the nation falls. With civilians helpless and fearing 
for their lives, players will be the last line of defense 
in preventing the total collapse of society.
