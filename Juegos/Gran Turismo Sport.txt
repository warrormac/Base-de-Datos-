	Gran Turismo Sport


The latest instalment of the Gran Turismo 
franchise is coming to PlayStation4 with 
the name Gran Turismo SPORT. The graphics, 
sound and physics engine promise to be the 
most realistic ever experienced in a driving 
simulator thanks to the new platform and the 
new technologies, but that alone would be a 
too obvious improvement: the way driving games 
are played also promise to undergo a revolution 
with Gran Turismo SPORT. This is a vision that 
invokes the rebirth of motorsports. The major 
difference between real life motorsports and 
Gran Turismo SPORT is in the fact that anyone, 
from children to the elderly, can participate 
and enjoy racing. Even players who have never 
played driving games until now can discover how 
fun it is to drive.
