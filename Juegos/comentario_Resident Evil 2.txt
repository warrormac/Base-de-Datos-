	Resident Evil 2


 In Resident Evil 2, the classic action, tense exploration, 
and puzzle solving gameplay that defined the Resident Evil 
series returns. Players join rookie police officer Leon 
Kennedy and college student Claire Redfield, who are thrust 
together by a disastrous outbreak in Raccoon City that 
transformed its population into deadly zombies. Both Leon 
and Claire have their own separate playable campaigns, 
allowing players to see the story from both characters’ 
perspectives. The fate of these two fan favorite characters is 
in players hands as they work together to survive and get to 
the bottom of what is behind the terrifying attack on the city. 
Will they make it out alive?
